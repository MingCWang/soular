## Challenges we ran into
This was our first time developing a mobile application, and we overestimated our ability to learn React Native, even though we knew React.
During development, we faced challenges such as time management, task allocation, and teamwork problems in solving technical issues. We had to set a cut-off point for our technical development and started writing our project devpost. This is a great lesson for every one of us, in a limited time frame, good time management is key.

## What's next for Soular
With the data collected from the analysis generated from the journal entries, we can use the user-inputted mood data with the AI-generated data, and further compare and generate a holistic analysis of the data, providing a fresh perspective to enhance users ability to learn about themselves and grow as a person.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In an era where mental well-being is often overlooked, Soular seeks to bridge the gap between mental and physical health. Our research indicates that mental health remains a neglected global issue, impacting the attainment of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Additionally, Asians often suffer from traditional mental health stigma.
