# Soular - HackHarvard 2023 

## Problem Statement
In an era where mental well-being is often overlooked, Soular seeks to bridge the gap between mental and physical health. Our research indicates that mental health remains a neglected global issue, specifically in the South East Asian families we come from. Journaling is a well-known remedy for this. However, Journaling is a one-way street â€” you write something down, but get little in return with just one likely-biased perspective, your own.

## Mission Statement
What makes us different? Unbiasy and Personalization. Through the power of AI, you're able to be provided an unbiased perspective on your journaling through an emotion extraction ML algorithm and statistic visualization. Don't just write something down and look back on it later on, write something down and be able to learn from it! In addition, we provide CONTEXT. Combine your long/short-term goals and the data from your past journals to create customizable suggestions on what you can work on in the future! Soular provides not just a one-time, a cheap way to journal. We're here for your long-term benefits, from an emotional calendar to TerraAPI graph visualizations and physical-activity integration, we provide a holistic approach towards not just journaling, but to learn more about yourself and better your mental health.

## Challenges we ran into
This was our first time developing a mobile application, and we overestimated our ability to learn React Native, even though we knew React.
During development, we faced challenges such as time management, task allocation, and teamwork problems in solving technical issues. We had to set a cut-off point for our technical development and started writing our project devpost. This is a great lesson for every one of us, in a limited time frame, good time management is key.

## What's next for Soular
With the data collected from the analysis generated from the journal entries, we can use the user-inputted mood data with the AI-generated data, and further compare and generate a holistic analysis of the data, providing a fresh perspective to enhance users ability to learn about themselves and grow as a person.
